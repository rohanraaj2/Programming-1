# Programming-1 Exercises

This repository contains a collection of programming exercises completed as part of a course at Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders by exercise number. Each folder contains Python scripts and, in some cases, supporting files such as data files or flowcharts. Below is an overview of the contents:

### Exercise 00 - 05
- Basic Python programming tasks, including loops, conditionals, and list operations.

### Exercise 06
- Multiple Python scripts (e.g., `1.1.py`, `2.a.py`) covering various small problems and algorithmic exercises.

### Exercise 10, 11
- Standalone Python scripts for more advanced problems.

### Exercise 14
- Object-oriented programming tasks, including classes like `Vehicle` and `Autobahn`.
- Includes a script for working with the IMDb API.

### Exercise 15
- Data handling exercises, including reading and writing CSV, JSON, and TXT files.
- Example data files: `data.csv`, `data.json`, `data.txt`.
- `reader.py` demonstrates file operations in Python.

### Exercise 16
- Includes a palindrome checker (`palindrome.py`) and additional class-based exercises (`Vehicle.py`).

### Other Files
- Some exercises include flowcharts (PDF/PNG) and ZIP archives with additional resources.

## Notes
The exercises cover a range of topics from basic programming to object-oriented design and data processing.
